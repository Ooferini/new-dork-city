          Hello! I'm Josef, a web designer with a passion for making
          good-looking, intuitive designs... but you already know that! I'm
          currently studying Integrated Design and Media at NYU, where I'm
          learning about human-computer interaction and user experience design,
          as well as web design/development tools like Figma and React.
        </p>
        <p className='text-2xl  font-mono'>
          I'm also passionate about musicâ€”I currently serve as the Tech Director
          at WNYU where I'm developing our new website. There, I also co-founded
          our music and culture magazine, STATIC. I care about cultivating
          community around music and want to work with others to uplift
          musicians and music lovers with technology and design.
